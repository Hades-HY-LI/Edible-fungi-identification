# Edible-fungi-identification
It's a project about identification of edible/non-edible fungi by by leveraging the power of pre-trained computer vision models ResNet.


Follow these steps to start running the project

- Data processing: Import, transform and load the images;
- Data processing test: Test the data loaded;
- Training model: Creating model training function;
- Visualization functions: Create visualization functions that will be used in this project;
- Accuracy and recall: Create functions for calculating the accuracy and recall of the trained model on the test dataset;
- Cited Focal Loss function: Import Focal loss function as criterion, and compare with `CrossEntropy`;
- Confusion matrix: Create confusion matrix function and its visualization;
- Comparison preparation: ResNet, LR, KNN, RF: Load the saved trained ResNet models, and train LR, KNN, RF model. Prepare them for later comparison;
- Model comparison: Draw PR Curve for comparison between the prepared models;
- main running file: By running the code in this file, get the results in the report.
